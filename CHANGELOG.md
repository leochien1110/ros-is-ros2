- Updated README.md with instructions for updating the package and new macros section.
- Improved shell shims for cleaner range generation in completion (using `seq` in Bash and brace expansion in Zsh).

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-20

### Added
- Integration with `complete-alias` for full tab completion on aliased ROS1 commands.

### Changed
- Updated project URL and tests.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-15
